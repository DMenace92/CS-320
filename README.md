•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

-  In this term I have learned in depth of the practice of j-unit testing. Ensuring the program security is the first priority creating a full coverage of testing on a function. The example I will use is the create contact functionality. Using a serverless program I put an array list for its alternative. With a the create function in place and using the add method we can add the data to the object array. Having the j-unit test in place we can create a insert coverage where we can analyze that the create function is creating the data form the input and stored into the array list.
 
•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

- Interpreting and incorporating the user needs in the projects was to identify what needs to be built. For example, creating a contact allows the user to register by entering their credentials like first name last name phone number and address. 

•	How do I approach designing software?

- Working on different project it being personal or professional project, my first step is to understand the what the projects’ function is and what problem it is problem it means to solve. After completing the research and analyze portion we can now create a UML diagram that will have the required classes and functions to build off from. Now that all the information and alysis are in place this where I start build the program.
